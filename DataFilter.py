#The dateFilter class has a dateFilter method. This method will need to take a dictionary (data) and return a modified dictionary that excludes values outside the user's choices
#Start date and end date will also be in the dictionary format. Example below

#dictionary example 
    #startDate = {
        # "year" : 2007
        # "month" : 11
        # "day" : 12
        # }

class dateFilter:
    def dateFilter(data, startDate, endDate):
        #replace pass with the code
        pass
        #data is passed to the date filter method in a dictionary.
